## Overview
This MATLAB code performs a finite element analysis of a 3D structural model. It calculates the global stiffness matrix, applies support conditions, computes the displacement and stress/strain distributions, and generates force-displacement graphs and visualizations of the deformed structure.

## Input
The code requires the following input:
- `nu`: Poisson's ratio
- `E0`: Young's modulus of the material
- `SigmaMax`: Compressive strength of the concrete
- `inputfile`: Mesh file in the format of "80nodes_1.msh"
- `sp`: Support matrix in the form [Node_no ux uy uz]
- `load`: Load matrix in the form [Node_no Fx Fy Fz]
- `NINC`: Number of load increments

## Output
The code generates the following output:
- `Node_and_Connectivity_2.jpg`: Plot of the node and element connectivity
- `Force-Displacement_Graph.jpg`: Force-displacement graph
- `Before_Deformed.jpg`: Visualization of the undeformed structure
- `After_Deformed.jpg`: Visualization of the deformed structure
- `ELEMENT_i_Actual_stress_x.txt`: Actual stress in the x-direction for element i
- `ELEMENT_i_strain_matrix.txt`: Strain matrix for element i
- `myWorkspace.mat`: Saved MATLAB workspace

## Main Steps
1. Read the mesh file and extract node coordinates, element connectivity, and support/load information.
2. Initialize the element and node data structures.
3. Calculate the element stiffness matrices using Gaussian integration.
4. Assemble the global stiffness matrix by accumulating the element stiffness contributions.
5. Apply the support conditions to the global stiffness matrix.
6. Compute the load vector and solve for the displacement field.
7. Calculate the nodal and element-level stress and strain distributions.
8. Generate the force-displacement graph and deformed structure visualization.
9. Save the results to the output files.

## Dependencies
The code uses the following MATLAB functions:
- `autoread`: Reads the mesh file and extracts the node coordinates and element connectivity.
- `Plot_Element01`: Plots the node and element connectivity.
- `savejpg`: Saves the deformed structure visualization.
- `lgwt`: Computes the Gauss-Legendre quadrature points and weights.
- `GetHDStressStiffness`: Calculates the stress and stiffness relationship for high-strength concrete.

## Notes
- The code assumes that the input mesh file follows the specified format.
- The support and load conditions are defined in the code and can be modified as needed.
- The code saves the final results in the MATLAB workspace and generated output files.
